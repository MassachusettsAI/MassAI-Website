Iâ€™ve done some research in interpretability and safety (exploring how models think) alongside experiments with computer vision models. I enjoy reading papers in medicine and ML and want to specialize in medical AI to increase diagnostic accuracy, surgical accuracy, enable the development of more complex laboratory-made proteins, and much more. Look forward to meeting y'all!"

I've worked on some research in Hyperspectral Image Clustering and Trustworthy AI / ML research. I really love soccer, so I'm currently exploring geometric DL to figure out how Barcelona can concede less goals. That said, I enjoy the math & algorithm side of things quite a bit, so I enjoy working on any applications of ML in real-life! Very excited for this upcoming semester!"
